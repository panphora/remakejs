# The Remake CLI

Use this Remake CLI to generate a Remake application.

The main framework & README is here: [Remake Framework](https://github.com/remake/remake-framework/).

## How to generate a Remake application

### 1. Install [Node.js (12.16+)](https://nodejs.org/)

### 2. Create a project using the Remake CLI

```sh
npx remake create my-app
```

### 3. Run the project

```sh
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You now have an app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Your app's code is in the `/app` directory and your user database is in the `/app/data` directory.
